## HW4, Assignment 2

I collaborated with Dana Karwas on this assignnment. The article I selected is, "The Queen and I: Neural Correlates of Altered Self-Related Cognitions in Major Depressive Episode." The authors used a t-test to determine that there was no significant difference between the age of the groups and that the BDI-II and Rosenberg scores differed significantly between the two groups. The participants where shown a series of positive, negative and neutral stimulus words in three rounds (self, queen, case). The answers either were in relation to themselvse or the Queen of England. The 'case' condition was answered based on if the stimulus word was shown in lower or upper case letters and was used as control for fMRI BOLD response. In the results, a 3-way ANOVA test was used for response time with group (control or depressed), category (self, queen, case) and valence (positive, negative, neutural). Linear regression was used between response time (self - queen) and positivity measure against the BDI-II and Rosenberg to determine if the measures were related to depressive symptoms. Comparasons between groups were done using a t-test for all nine conditions (categories x valences). A general linear model was constructed between the same nine conditions and fMRI response.

| **Statistical Analyses | Chi_Square | Linear Regression, 3-Way ANOVA, T-test |
| ---|---|---|
| IV(s) | the color of the PTL test | Positive, negative and neutral stimulus words |
| IV type(s) | Male Colour PTL and Female Colour PTL | Categorical Nominal | 
| DV(s) |?   | Percentage of responses answered 'yes;' Response time (self - queen); 'Positivity Measure' defined as % response 'yes' to positive words subtracted by % response 'yes' to negative words; Functional-MRI Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response  |

| Control Var |Gender | Major Depressive; Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II); Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory |
| Control Var Types | Male and female | Categorical Dichotomous; Continuous Interval; Continuous Interval |
| Question to be Answered | Does Gender Influence Colour Choice in the Treatment of Visual Stress? | Do self-related negative thoughts in people suffering a Major Depressive Episode effect brain activity in an fMRI |
