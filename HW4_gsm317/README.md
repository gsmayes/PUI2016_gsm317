## HW4, Assignment 1

For assignment 1, I was directed by the professor to review HW3, assignment 2 completed by sck408. To do this, I forked and cloned the directory PUI2016_sck408 and created a markdown file for my comments. I then submitted a pull request from sck408, which hasn't been answered to date.

## HW4, Assignment 2

I collaborated with Dana Karwas on this assignnment. The article I selected is, "The Queen and I: Neural Correlates of Altered Self-Related Cognitions in Major Depressive Episode." The authors used a t-test to determine that there was no significant difference between the age of the groups and that the BDI-II and Rosenberg scores differed significantly between the two groups. The participants where shown a series of positive, negative and neutral stimulus words in three rounds (self, queen, case). The answers either were in relation to themselvse or the Queen of England. The 'case' condition was answered based on if the stimulus word was shown in lower or upper case letters and was used as control for fMRI BOLD response. In the results, a 3-way ANOVA test was used for response time with group (control or depressed), category (self, queen, case) and valence (positive, negative, neutural). Linear regression was used between response time (self - queen) and positivity measure against the BDI-II and Rosenberg to determine if the measures were related to depressive symptoms. Comparasons between groups were done using a t-test for all nine conditions (categories x valences). A general linear model was constructed between the same nine regressions and fMRI response.
