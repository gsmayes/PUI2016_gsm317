#Assignment 3: 
Practice formulating the null hypothesis. For this assignment I worked with Dana Karwas; she developed the initial narative hypothesis, which I comment on and added the equations.

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

##H0 = The % of fat lost in adults who dieted during the study period is less than or equal those who exercised during the same period.

##Control sample = % of fat lost by exercise over study period

##Test sample = % of fat lost by dieting over study period

##Ha = %fat_diet > %fat_exercise

##H0 = %fat_diet <= %fat_exercise
 

Do Americans trust the president? POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

##H0 = Assuming a 'yes' response to the poll question "From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?" is an indication of trust, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of 'yes' responses is less than or equal to 'no' response, within a significance of 5%.

##Ha = %yes > %no

##H0 = %yes <= %no
 
 
Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

#H0= The percentage of cessation rates of former smokers that used the nicotine patch to quit smoking is less than or equal to candidates who participated in the placebo patch program as for the control group.

##Cessation rate = CR

##Ha: CR_nicotine > CR_placebo

##H0: CR_nicotine <= CR_placebo
 
 
Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

#H0= The IQ of children measured at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years is less than or equal to the IQ of children who had mothers that smoked during pregnancy as for the control group.

##H0_1: IQ_non_1 <= IQ_smoke_1 
##H0_2: IQ_non_2 <= IQ_smoke_2
##H0_3: IQ_non_3 <= IQ_smoke_3
##H0_4: IQ_non_4 <= IQ_smoke_4
