## Review by gsm317
 - The axis tick labels for number of rides is difficult to read, as are the description labels for both axes.
 - The legend colors don't match the plot, red looks purple due to an overlap with blue.
 - The error bars are very small relative to the plot bars and are difficult to differentiate between the days of the week.
 - The customer plot bars are very small compared to subscribers and it's difficult to gauge their value against each other and the y-axis
 - The figure caption contained in the ipython notebook doesn't define rides (citibike) or the data source.
 
Overall, I think the main point of this plot is the comparison of customer rides in relation to the subscriber rides through out the week. Rather than representing total rides for both categories, maybe show total rides in thousands and the percentage of customer rides within the bar for total rides. Also, I'm not sure if there was a particular reason for selecting the month of March, but I suggest using multiple months of data during peak periods of outdoor activity (June, July and August). It would also be interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between customer rides and tourist population (or hotel occupancy rates, airport arrivals, etc.)
