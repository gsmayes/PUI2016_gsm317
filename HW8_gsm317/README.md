## Review of visualization by cx495 
 - The axis tick labels for number of rides is difficult to read, as are both axis description labels.
 - The legend colors don't match the plot, red looks purple due to an overlap with blue.
 - The error bars are very small relative to the plot bars and are difficult to differentiate between the days of the week.
 - The customer plot bars are very small compared to subscribers and it's difficult to gauge their value against each other and the y-axis
 - The figure caption contained the ipython notebook doesn't define rides (citibike) or the data source.
 
Overall, I think the main point of this plot is the comparison of customer rides in relation to the subscriber rides. Rather than representing total rides for both categories, maybe show total rides in thousands and the percentage of customer rides against total rides.

## Review of visualization by lag552 
 - The data being used is not clear to me because I don't believe there are any prisons for violent offenders in New York City. I suspect the inmate population represent detention facilities operated by the NYC Department of Corrections, chiefly on Rikers Island and with smaller facilities in several boroughs. It's also not clearly stated if the population is men, women or both and what level of incarceration.
 - It might be helpful to represent the number of incidents as per capita against inmate population in thousands. This would make the scale of each axis more similar.
 - It's not clear to me why specifically stabbings/slashings were used rather than the overall violent incidents, which may be less random.

Overall, the plot is very clear in conveying it's point, but a more interesting analysis might be using the New York State inmate population of 55,245 and breaking the data down by prison facility or even better by block. Also, further specify the population by security level (maximum), gender (male), age or sentence.
